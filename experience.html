        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>When it comes to design, I focus on all things visual. I find myself engaged in email campaigns, SEO landing pages, site design, app design, and other graphic projects. My go-to software is Illustrator, but I also dive into Photoshop, After Effects, Sketch, and Hype3 frequently. I probably drink too much coffee. Your dog will love me. The feeling will be mutual.</p>

          <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
          <h4>Poll Everywhere, Designer, 2015-2017</h4>
          <p>As the graphic and visual designer I provided art and design to Marketing. This included landing page mocks, web assets, print assets, newsletter layouts, emails, promotional goods, and anything else that was visual in nature. I worked closely with copywriters and iterated quickly on ideas. The fast back-and-forth interplay with the team was one of the highlights of my role.</p>
          <h4>SAP, Design Intern, 2014-2015</h4>
          <p>In SAP’s Design &amp; Co-Innovation Center I created story-driven materials. Following the Design Thinking methodology, I worked with a team to facilitate workshops and group activities for clients. I also assisted designers in creating new visual assets for still and motion graphics. I acted as photographer and videographer for many projects.</p>
          <h4>FilmFest, Design Intern, 2013-2014</h4>
          <p>This was a lean startup getting on their feet. As their only designer I redesigned the logo for the company and produced all graphics used in-app and in advertising. I assisted with visual design of the product across multiple platforms including Roku, iOS, Android, and web. I also created storyboards, animatics, and videos for short motion graphic pieces. </p>
          <h4>Freelance, Graphic Designer, 2012-2015</h4>
          <p>I produced graphic pieces tailored to each client’s needs. This included branding services, logo design, print design, web design, and photography.</p>
