          <h2>Landing Pages</h2>
          <img src="images/landing-page.jpg" class="card-photo"> 
          <h3>Overview:</h3> 
          <p>Poll Everywhere is an audience response system (ARS) that works with any web-connected device. I designed landing pages to convey the benefits of Poll Everywhere and increase sign-up rates.</p>

          <h3>Goal:</h3> 
          <p>The majority of pages were made to drive conversions. They often had a target SEO keyword that played to our organic traffic strategy. Pages designed to inform the user were crafted with a specific CTA in mind, eg. ‘Try Q&A polling’.</p>

          <h3>Process:</h3> 
          <p>When I started at Poll Everywhere I built every page from scratch. First I drafted a medium fidelity layout, then added copy from the marketing team. Partnering with a content marketer, we made changes and added assets until the mock looked right. I submitted a high fidelity mock to stakeholders for review. If they had no further changes, I created a detailed mock with annotated directions for the developer.</p>

          <p>Building each page from scratch was time-consuming, so eventually we moved to a componentized system for web pages. Using modular components, I drafted a layout with the content marketer’s copy. We made small changes, and finally produced assets for the page. A simple mock was then passed to a developer. It didn’t need annotations, since we had already documented each component’s parameters for the engineering team.</p>

          <h2>Emails</h2>
          <img src="images/email.jpg" class="card-photo"> 
          <h3>Overview:</h3> 
          <p>Poll Everywhere is an audience response system (ARS) that works with any web-connected device. Quarterly, and on special occasions, we published a newsletter-style email for a million of our most engaged users. It included new uses for the application, new features, contest announcements, and information on the weekly webinar.</p>

          <h3>Goal:</h3> 
          <p>The newsletter’s success metric was opens, along with clicks, to measure engagement. On a few occasions, the goal was to re-engage users who hadn’t logged in for a few months, and entice them to come back and create new polls.</p>

          <h3>Process:</h3> 
          <p>For each section of the email we wanted to a link back a blog or webpage on our site. This meant that for new features or other news, we had to make sure we had a landing site ready to go, before we could send out the newsletter. A content marketer would write the copy, and it would be vetted by list of stakeholders. I created templates and graphics, crafted the newsletter in HTML, tested the code for all major email clients, and then imported it into MailChimp for distribution. We usually made 3-5 different versions of the newsletter to target different user segments.</p>

          <h2>Sales Collateral</h2>
          <img src="images/sales-collateral.jpg" class="card-photo"> 
          <h3>Overview:</h3> 
          <p>Poll Everywhere is an audience response system (ARS) that works with any web-connected device. Even though the application lives on the web, there’s always demand for printed collateral, usually for conferences and sales meetings. The sales department also uses PDF’s of the collateral as email attachments.</p>

          <h3>Goal:</h3> 
          <p>Engage customers and prospects with sales material – printed or emailed in PDF form.</p>

          <h3>Process:</h3> 
          <p>My first task was to investigate the purpose and distribution method of each piece of collateral. For example, sales collateral for a conference needed to be optimized for professional printing, while something used as an email attachment would appear in a PDF viewer, and perhaps get printed from an office printer. Once I knew the purpose and distribution method, I sourced copy from a content marketer. Then I created a rough layout, got feedback from stakeholders, and finalized it. Since Poll Everywhere went through a rebranding during my employment I had the opportunity to rebrand the sales collateral to be uniform and to adhere to our new branding. I user-tested several layouts and vetted them with stakeholders. The final product was produced in Adobe InDesign.</p>

          <h2>Inforgraphics</h2>
          <img src="images/inforgraphic.jpg" class="card-photo"> 
          <h3>Overview:</h3> 
          <p>Poll Everywhere is an audience response system (ARS) that works with any web-connected device. To improve user engagement and encourage signups, we designed a campaign around infographics to share across social networks.</p>

          <h3>Goal:</h3> 
          <p>Engage people on social media to increase acquisition.</p>

          <h3>Process:</h3> 
          <p>Looking through our blog, we found several perennially popular posts. I repurposed those topics into infographics that could be broken apart and then shared in pieces on social networks. For each infographic, we created a blog post to bring new visitors into the acquisition funnel.</p>
